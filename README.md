This extension generates automatic session titles for [pi](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono).

## What it does

- The extension sets a title after the **first request fully settles**.
- Pi completes automatic retries, compaction recovery, and queued continuation before automatic naming starts.
- The extension uses the original request, the final response from the assistant, tool names, and relevant paths.
- The extension does not change the title when you resume an existing session.
- The `/rename-session` command regenerates the title from the full conversation.

Before automatic naming is complete, the session has no explicit title. Pi shows the first user message in the session selector.

## Install

```bash
pi install git:github.com/edxeth/pi-auto-session-titles
```

## Configuration

Set a dedicated model for automatic naming in `~/.pi/agent/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "autoSessionTitles": {
    "enabled": true,
    "provider": "zai",
    "model": "glm-5v-turbo",
    "thinkingLevel": "high"
  }
}
```

If you omit `thinkingLevel`, automatic naming uses `minimal` thinking. This value prevents inheritance of a slow setting for high-reasoning chat.

If you omit `autoSessionTitles.model`, the extension uses the default model of Pi.

## Commands

### `/rename-session`

This command regenerates the session title from the current branch. It uses the full transcript between the user and the assistant.
The transcript evidence is bounded: each message is capped at 1,500 characters and the total at 24,000 characters. The extension keeps the first message and the most recent messages, and replaces omitted middle turns with a marker.

When title generation fails, the warning names the reason: disabled configuration, a missing title model, authentication failure, a request timeout, a provider error, or output that failed title validation. Provider and credential errors are reduced to safe classifications (rate limit, credentials rejected, server error, network failure); raw error text, payloads, and credentials are never shown. On failure the current title is kept. `/name <title>` is the immediate workaround that sets a session name without AI.

A failed title request never produces a fallback title. The deterministic fallback (the opening message's first words) applies only when the title model answered but its output failed validation.

## Notes

- Automatic naming sets only blank session titles.
- If another extension or launcher sets a title first, this extension keeps that title unchanged.
- The `/rename-session` command provides manual title regeneration.
- Automatic naming uses the original request, the final response from the assistant, and tool names.
- When the agent uses built-in file tools, automatic naming includes up to 20 normalized file paths.
- These built-in tools provide a known path field:
  - `read`
  - `edit`
  - `write`
  - `grep`
  - `find`
  - `ls`
- The extension does not extract file paths from custom tools or shell commands.
- The extension does not send these items to the title model:
  - assistant thinking
  - tool-result contents
  - file contents
  - bash commands
  - custom-tool arguments
  - images
  - system prompts
  - available tool schemas
  - other session metadata
- A bare skill invocation, such as `/skill:migrate`, is not the session goal.
- Automatic naming relies on the work that the agent reports and the files that the agent touches.
- The extension limits each context field and the total input for automatic naming.
- The extension also limits the `/rename-session` transcript, so very large sessions do not exceed the title model's context window.
- The extension stops a title-model request after 60 seconds.
- The configured title model receives relevant paths. These paths can reveal project structure, but they do not contain file contents.
- The extension does not change an automatic title after creation. Compaction does not start automatic naming again.
- Titles are written in Traditional Chinese (Taiwan) with Taiwan terminology. The prompt forbids Mainland Chinese terms and Simplified characters. Code identifiers, file names, commands, and English proper nouns keep their original form and casing.
- The language rule lives in the prompt only. Code does not check the title language.
- The title prompt states the character budget before generation. Titles are capped at 72 characters.
- An invalid title (over length, over word count, or incomplete ending) triggers one regeneration. The retry prompt names the rejected title and the reason.
- If regeneration still fails, the deterministic fallback applies: the opening message's first words, capped in length. Code never truncates a model title as the primary enforcement.
- A failed title request (provider error, timeout, missing model, authentication) never produces a fallback title; the existing title is kept.
- The configuration for the title model uses `autoSessionTitles.provider`, `autoSessionTitles.model`, and `autoSessionTitles.thinkingLevel` in `~/.pi/agent/settings.json`.

## Development

Install the development dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

Run the project verification:

```bash
bun run verify
```

The `verify` command runs the behavior tests and the TypeScript type check.
